SYSOUT Retrieval Services (SRS) is a product that retrieves data from
the JES spool using the SYSOUT Application Program Interface (SAPI).
SRS supports a robust set of SYSOUT selection criteria (documented
below) that can be specified by the user on the EXEC PARM= statement.
Using these criteria, SRS builds the necessary data structures and
calls SAPI asking for SYSOUT data that matches the selection request.
If JES finds and returns a spool data set, SRS copies the data to a
file specified by the user.

For more complex applications, SRS supports a user-written "despooler"
routine.  In this mode, SRS still processes selection criteria, and
makes the SAPI call.  But instead of writing the spool data to a file,
SRS calls the despooler routine, one record at a time, to process the
data.  The SRSJWRAP program (which is included with SRS) is one example
of a special despooler routine.

SRS can be invoked from a batch job or started task as follows:

//DESPOOL EXEC SRS,PARM='<options>'

<options> specify a combination of SRS control options and SYSOUT
selection criteria.  An explanation of each option follows.
Required characters are in uppercase while optional characters are
in lowercase.  For example, the DDname keyword can be specified as
DD=, DDN=, DDNA=, DDNAM=, or DDNAME=.

The following options specify what SYSOUT to select.

Q=<c> -or-  The SYSOUT class
CLASS=<c>   default: none
            example: CLASS=A

Jobname=    The jobname (wild-card characters supported)
 <jobname>  default: none
            example: JOBN=MYJOB

JI=         The 8-character JES jobid
 <jobid> or default: none
JOBId=      example: JOBI=J98754 or JI=JOB98754
 <jobid>

Dest=       The destination (or 'ALL' to select all destinations)
 <destid>   default: LOCAL
            example: DEST=SRSDEST

Forms=      The forms ID (or 'ALL' to select all forms)
 <forms>    default: STD
            example: FORMS=STDX

Writer=     The writer name (or 'ALL' to select all writer names)
 <writer>   default: null (SYSOUT with NO writer name)
            example: WRITER=SRSWTR

STATus=     The status of data sets to select
 <status>   'HELD', 'NONHELD', or 'ALL' can be specified
            default: NONHELD

DDname=     The DDNAME of the spool data set (wild-card
 <ddname>   characters supported)
            default: none
            example: DD=JES*


The following options control SRS processing.

Program=    The name of the special despooler program
 <pgnmane>  default: none (SRSGENER is used)

PPARM=      Parameter list passed to the despooler program
 (parms)    or to the standard despooler routine.
            Note: parms must be enclosed in parentheses.
            default: none

LIMit=      The maximum number of output groups to select (1-9999)
 <lim>      default: no limit

WAIT=YES/NO Whether SRS is to wait for data sets or end when no
            more spool data sets remain to select
            default: NO if invoked in batch; YES if STC

DISP=       The disposition of selected spool data sets
 <disp>     'KEEP' or 'DELETE' can be specified.
            default: DELETE

SEP=        Specifies whether separator records are to be written to
 <sep_opt>  the output data stream prior to the actual SYSOUT data.
            Valid options are:

            JOB - writes a record containing the job name and JOBID
                  before each job's selected SYSOUT

            OUTGRP - writes a record containing (in addition to the JOB
              or     record) the SYSOUT class, destination, writer name,
             YES     forms name, and output group name before each
                     output group's selected SYSOUT

            DATASET - writes a record containing (in addition to the
              or      OUTGRP record) the DDNAME before each data set's
              DS      selected SYSOUT

            NO - no separator records are produced

            Default: NO

SEPId=      Specifies a one to eight byte character string that can be
 <sepid>    used to identify separator records.  <sepid> will appear
            at the beginning of each separator.
            default: *SRS>
            example: SEPID=**SEP**

OPTs=       Specifies a one or two character suffix that is appended
 <options>  to 'SRSOPT' to form the options module name.  The options
            module must be accessible (STEPLIB, link list, etc.) and
            must have been created using a current version of the
            SRSOPTS macro.
            default: S (uses module SRSOPTS)
            example: OPTS=99 (uses module SRSOPT99)

The following options can be specified on the PPARM= keyword if
default processing (i.e. no special despooler program) is in effect.

OUTFILE=file Specifies the DDNAME of the data set to write spool data
             records to
             default: SYSUT2

DEFER_OPEN=YES/NO Specifies whether the OUTFILE= file should be opened
                  at SRS initialization or after the first record is
                  despooled.  If 'YES' is specified and the OUTFILE=
                  file is a new data set that does not specify LRECL
                  information, SRS will use the record length of the
                  first record despooled as the LRECL.  If 'NO', LRECL
                  must be specified on the OUTFILE= file or a S013-34
                  abend will occur.
                  default: YES
