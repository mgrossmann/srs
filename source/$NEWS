Enhancements in this release:

1. SRS now exploits SAPI support for problem state callers, provided in
   z/OS 1.9.  The SRS Linklib no longer has to be APF Authorized and
   all SRS code now runs in key 8 problem state.

2. When SRS is invoked with the DISP=KEEP option, JESSPOOL READ
   authority is now required for each spool data set selected by SRS.
   In prior releases, UPDATE authority was always required.
   For DISP=DELETE, JESSPOOL UPDATE continues to be required.

3. DDNAME 'SYSSAPI' is no longer used to dynamically allocate
   spool data sets.  SRS will use the DDNAME generated by Dynamic
   Allocation.

4. SRSTASK has been changed to use 31-bit SAM and is now linked RMODE ANY.
