SRS Installation Instructions:

***---------------------------------------------------------------***
*** Note that this release of SRS requires z/OS 1.9 or higher.    ***
*** For older releases of z/OS, please continue to use SRS 1.2.1. ***
***---------------------------------------------------------------***

1. SRS is distributed in two files: src.xmt (source code) and
   linklib.xmt (execution library).  The files are in TSO TRANSMIT form
   and must be unformatted with the TSO RECEIVE command to translate
   them into useable PDSes.

2. Binary Upload both files.
   - If using IND$FILE or a similar file transfer program DO NOT
     specify 'Convert to EBCDIC' or 'Delete CRLF'.
   - If using FTP, specify BINARY transfer mode

3. For each file, issue TSO command RECEIVE INDS(dsn), where dsn is the
   data set name assigned to each uploaded file.  When message INMR906A
   appears, enter DS(newdsn) to specify the desired names for the source
   and execution libraries on your system.

4. It is NOT necessary to APF authorize the execution library.

5. Member SRS in the source library is a sample cataloged procedure that
   can be used to invoke SRS.  Change the STEPLIB data set name to the
   execution library name you've chosen for your system.  Make any other
   updates to suit your installation standards and copy the proc to a
   system procedure library or use a JCLLIB statement in SRS execution
   JCL to point to the SRS source library.

NOTES:

- Review the $ABOUT member in the source library for information
  on how to use SRS.

- SRS 1.3.0 was assembled on z/OS 1.9.  The Linklib shipped should be
  upward compatible with future releases.

- SRS was originally written by Dave Danner but is now maintained by
  Michael Knigge. If you have any comments, fixes, enhancements or
  bug reports, please visit the SRS GitHub page and open an issue or.
